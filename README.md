# VIREX Protocol – v0.1.0-alpha  
**Author:** Syon Foppen  
**Status:** Alpha – early stage, experimental, not production ready  

---

## ⚠️ Important Learning Disclaimer  

This project exists to **learn about cryptography**, **secure communication protocols**, and **privacy-preserving technologies** by designing and documenting a hypothetical protocol called **VIREX**.  

- It is **not production-ready** and should **not be used as-is**.  
- It has **not been audited** for real-world security.  
- It is **for educational and research purposes only**.  

All designs include **abuse prevention**, **transparency**, and **auditing mechanisms**, but security feedback is highly encouraged as part of the learning process.

## About This Project  

VIREX (**Verifiable Infrastructure for Routing with Encryption and eXtensibility**) is a **learning project** designed to explore:  
- Modern cryptography and mixnet-based privacy systems  
- Metadata protection and anonymous routing  
- Key transparency and anonymous key discovery  
- Abuse resistance and federated governance mechanisms  

The primary goal is to **learn and document** how secure, privacy-preserving communication protocols can be designed, and to invite **public feedback** from the community.  

This project is **not intended for criminal or illegal use**. It exists for **educational and research purposes** only.  

---

## Alpha Disclaimer  

- This is **v0.1.0-alpha**, an **early draft** of the VIREX protocol specification.  
- The protocol design **will change** based on public review and security feedback.  
- **Do not** use this alpha version in production systems.  
- Reference implementations are not yet included in this release – only **specifications, governance documents, and diagrams** are provided.  

---

## Project Goals  

1. Learn and apply modern cryptographic primitives in a real-world protocol context.  
2. Explore **metadata privacy** using mixnets, Poisson delays, and dummy traffic.  
3. Design **end-to-end encryption** and **anonymous key discovery** using verifiable logs.  
4. Include **abuse resistance** (proof-of-work, quotas) to prevent misuse.  
5. Use **federated governance** and **transparent auditing** to ensure trust minimization.
