# VIREX Governance Documentation – v0.1.0-alpha  

**Author:** Syon Foppen  
**Status:** Alpha – for public feedback only  

---

## Overview  

The `governance/` folder contains all documents related to **VIREX’s federated governance model**, including:  
- How critical actions require **M-of-N approvals**  
- How **Transparency Logs** make changes verifiable and tamper-evident  
- How **Auditors** provide independent oversight and public accountability  

Together, these components ensure **distributed trust**, **resilience against insider threats**, and **public verifiability** of all governance actions.

## Recommended Reading Order  

1. **Governance.md**  
   - Learn how federated governance works in VIREX.  
   - Understand roles like federation members, auditors, and node operators.  

2. **TransparencyLogs.md**  
   - Explore how transparency logs use **Merkle Trees** for tamper-evident history.  
   - Learn about inclusion proofs, consistency proofs, and checkpointing.  

3. **AuditorGuidelines.md**  
   - Understand how auditors verify logs, detect misbehavior, and publish public reports.  
   - Learn about evidence requirements, security practices, and cross-verification processes.  

---

## Key Concepts  

- **M-of-N Approvals:** Critical actions like node onboarding, key rotations, and removals require multiple independent signatures.  
- **Transparency Logs:** Provide append-only, verifiable records for all governance events.  
- **Auditor Oversight:** Independent entities verify logs, monitor node behavior, and publish misbehavior reports.  
- **Public Accountability:** All governance actions are verifiable by anyone through cryptographic proofs.  

---

## Future Roadmap  

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Audits:** Privacy-preserving log verification for sensitive governance actions.  
- **Automated Auditor Agents:** Continuous monitoring and real-time reporting.  
- **Blockchain Anchoring:** Publishing log checkpoints to public blockchains for stronger immutability guarantees.
