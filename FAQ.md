This FAQ addresses common questions about the VIREX protocol, its purpose, and the current alpha release.  

---

## General Questions

### What is VIREX?
VIREX stands for **Verifiable Infrastructure for Routing with Encryption and eXtensibility**.  
It is a **learning project** designed to explore cryptography, privacy-preserving communication, and secure protocol design.

### Is VIREX production-ready?
No. This project is **alpha-stage** and exists for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It should **not** be used in real-world deployments yet.

### Who maintains VIREX?
Currently, the project is maintained by its creator and open to community feedback via GitHub Issues and Discussions.

## Technical Questions

### What does the alpha version include?
- Protocol documentation and threat models.
- Governance, transparency logs, and auditing concepts.
- Workflows for messaging, key discovery, and abuse prevention.
- Initial repository structure with placeholders for future code.

### Will there be a reference implementation?
Yes, planned for future versions (v0.2.0-alpha onwards).  
Initial prototypes may be written in **.NET**, **Rust**, or **Go**.

### What cryptography does VIREX use?
Currently, VIREX explores modern asymmetric encryption, mixnet routing, and verifiable logs.  
Post-quantum cryptography will be evaluated in future milestones.
